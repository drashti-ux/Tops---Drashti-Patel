//Q3.What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.
Ans:
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software engineers and project managers to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. 
Given below are the various phases of SDLC
1.Planning and Requirement gathering:
During this phase, all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation. Any ambiguities must be resolved in this phase only.
2.Designing:
In this phase, the software design is created, which includes the overall architecture of the software, data structures, and interfaces.
It has two steps:
High-level design (HLD): It gives the architecture of software products.
Low-level design (LLD): It describes how each and every feature in the product should work and every component.
3.Coding or Implementation :
In this phase Software design is translated into source code.All the components of the software are implemented in this phase.
4.Testing:
In this phase, the developed software is tested thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed.
5.Deployment:
After successful testing, The software is deployed to a production environment and made available to end-users.
6.Maintenance:
After the deployment of a product on the production environment, maintenance of the product i.e. if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers.
